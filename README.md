# PyGames
python games that I make in school cause why not

Clicker game needs:
pygame, math, sys, os.path and numerize

Pygame:
pip install pygame
py -m pip install pygame
python.exe -m pip install pygame

Numerize:
pip install numerize
py -m pip install numerize
python.exe -m pip install numerize

math, sys and os.path should be built-in but if they are not then do the same for them

Simon says (red, green, blue and yellow square) needs.
pygame, time

Pygame:
pip install pygame
py -m pip install pygame
python.exe -m pip install pygame

Time:
pip install time
py -m pip install time
python.exe -m pip install time




BE AWERE THE ART USED IN THE GAMES IS NOT MINE
